# bash-in-practice

Practical examples of using bash as a systems engineer's tool.
The repository is used for learning, experimenting and documenting
real problems solved in the system shell.

Scope:
- working on the file system
- text processing
- loops and conditions
- automation
- CI/CD task simulations

Not every task is suitable for bash - and that's part of learning too.
